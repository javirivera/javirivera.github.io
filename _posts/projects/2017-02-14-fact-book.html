<p>The rise and spread of fake news in social media has been a developing concern in recent times. The proliferation of misinformation throughout facebook has prompted it to take action against such publications.</p>

<p>At the time this project was proposed the 2016 presidential elections had just ocurred. The posiblility of fake news influencing the election was a concern being reported on by the media. I believe this issue is one of the greatest challenges we're facing Today. When I was prompted to select an industry and a problem to research at the UX Design course at General Assembly, I chose the spread of inaccurate news on social media.</p>


<h2>Hypothesis</h2>
<p>After researching literature about this problem I formulated the following hypothesis: <br><br><q class="big">People have difficulty finding accurate news.</q></p>

<h2>Ecosystem Analysis</h2>
	<p>I studied the ecosystem of services attending news and social media as well as other services that help users fact check. I identified direct and indirect competitive services and rated their features on a scale. I found:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>An unattended sector on the curation and the accountability aspects on the Facebook’s and Twitter’s social platform.</li>
		<li>Politifact’s Fact-o-meter system, while helpful as a reference, is accountabile only to themselves within their platform, no rating system exists for the public.</li>
		<li>Adapting the experience of fact checking into facebook instead of a third party website can help bridge the gap between accountability, curation and community.</li>
	</ul>

</div>


<div class="col col--2-of-3">

<h2>Research</h2>

<p>A quick round of 7 user interviews was completed with people that mainly use social media to consume news. The goal of the interviews was to understand more about people's attitudes towards news they find on social media and how they decide what to trust.</p>
</div>
<div class="col col--2-of-3">

<h4>People interviewed:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Are skeptical of everything they read on facebook because of the bias they’ve experienced from most sources.
	<li>Value the convenience facebook offers while browsing a lot of content.</li>
	<li>Trust sources based on their age and previous familiarity with them.</li>
	<li>Use repetition by other sources within the timeline to assess  the accuracy of an article.</li>
</ul>

</div>

<div class="col col--2-of-3">

<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>What I learned through the interviews helped me revise my hypothesis and formulate a new more granular problem to design for. Instead of people having difficulty finding accurate news I found that:</p>
<q class="big">People find fact-checking news on Facebook time-consuming.</q>

<h2>Persona</h2>
<p>Knowing the right type of person that faces this problem is essential to design a tool for fact-checking. Focusing my research I created one persona to design for. Meet Samantha Young.</p>
