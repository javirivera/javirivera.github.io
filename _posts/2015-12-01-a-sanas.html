<p>Yesenia had a new business that needed an identity that reflected the nature of the business. Her new yoga practice integrates aromatherapy and workshops to assist in healing and improving the quality of life.</p>
	
<p>After a few meetings to shape the brand direction, I was clear on the qualities that would help us name and dress the brand for it's position in the market. A focus on service to a specific audience helped us arrive at the best name, design, and identity. </p>

<h2>The Name</h2>
<p>Understanding the aspects of this new practice, a reference to the methods and services of the business started to form. The name "a-sanas" surfaced when overlaying the word <i>asana</i>, yoga position, with <i>sanas</i> which is the spanish word for healing. And the name was settled.</p>
<h2>The Mark</h2>
<p>The tree asana <i>Vriksha-asana</i> was selected to inform the logo because of it's challenging nature of balance and the possibility to achieve it. It is a posture that focuses the mind and cultivates concentration. The Pink Aura indicates that the person achieved a perfect balance between spiritual awareness and the material existence.</p>
