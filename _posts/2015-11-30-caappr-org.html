<p>Enlace Informativo is a platform for the sharing and review of the new public documents. They needed a logo for the online platform that would work as a news/blog site. New public documents would be explained as they came out. </p>
	
<h2>The Mark</h2>
<p>Two options were presented to the Torrados at first. None of which sparked real interest from them. I decided to go a totally different route with a more caligraphic approach to the brand, using type that flowed like cream. Simple and robust, the use black and white was there from the start.</p>

<h2>The Product Packaging</h2>
<p>Three products needed a package and label designed. A Clandestino —clandestine— cheese, a guayaba greek yogurt, and a coconut greek yogurt.</p>
<p>The concept for the product packaging line came along with some experimentation with ink, watercolors, and oil paint. Using the flowing qualities of the paints and inks I created backgrounds for the packages and labels. A certain sloppiness was desired, balancing the image of a quality product coming from a very small company.</p>
