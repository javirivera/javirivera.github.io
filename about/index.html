      <h1>Hi there!</h1>
        <p>I'm Javier, a passionate designer interested by the overlaping of identity, user experience, and technology.</p>

        <p>Located in Boston MA, I'm a multidisciplinary designer with a user centered approach to problem solving. </p>

<p>
I'm always on the lookout for new opportunities to challenge myself, whether it be partnering with clients or joining a team in which I can be a valuable asset while quenching my curiosity as a designer.</p>
	<p>Think I can help you, or form part of your team?</p>
