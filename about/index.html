        <p>I'm Javier, a passionate designer interested by the overlaping of identity, user experience, and technology.</p>

I'm always on the lookout for new opportunities to challenge myself, whether it be partnering with individual clients or with a team in which I can be a valuable asset while exploring my curiosity as a designer.</p
