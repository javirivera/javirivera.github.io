        <h2>I'm a passionate designer interested by the overlaping of identity, user experience, and technology.</h2>
         <p>Hello there, my name is Javier Rivera. I live in Puerto Rico and regularly find my way to Boston and New York City.</p>
			<p>I graduated on June 2013 from the Polytechnic University of Puerto Rico with a Bachelor's degree in Architecture. During my time as an architecture student I got interested in graphic design, photography and identity design to compliment my education. Eager to learn more while doing, I started offering services in these disciplines for individuals, institutions and businesses while in college. After graduation I continued to freelance as a designer, and here I am now.</p>
<p>
I'm always on the lookout for new opportunities to challenge myself, whether it be partnering with individual clients or with a team in which I can be a valuable asset while exploring my curiosity as a designer.</p
	<p>Think I can help you, or form part of your team?</p>
<p>Don't hesitate to contact me!</p>
