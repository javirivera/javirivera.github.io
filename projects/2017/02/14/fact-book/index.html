<p>The rise and spread of fake news in social media has been a developing concern in recent times. The proliferation of misinformation throughout Facebook has prompted it to take action against such publications. This project aims to explore what would be a better fact-checking experience within Facebook. </p>

<p>At the time this project was proposed the 2016 presidential elections had just ocurred. The posiblility of fake news influencing the election was a concern being reported on by the media. I believe this issue is one of the greatest challenges we're facing Today. When I was prompted to select an industry and a problem to research at the UX Design course at General Assembly, I chose the spread of inaccurate news on social media.</p>


<h2>Hypothesis</h2>
<p>After researching literature about this problem I formulated the following hypothesis: <br><br><q class="big">People have difficulty finding accurate news.</q></p>
</div>

</div>

<div class="project-full-width black-section">
<div class="project-content row">

<div class="col col--2-of-3">


<h2>Competitive Review</h2>
	<p>I studied the ecosystem of services attending news and social media as well as other services that help users fact check. I identified direct and indirect competitive services and rated their features on a scale. I found:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>An unattended sector on the curation and the accountability aspects on the Facebook’s and Twitter’s social platform.</li>
		<li>Politifact’s Fact-o-meter system, while helpful as a reference, is accountabile only to themselves within their platform, no rating system exists for the public.</li>
		<li>Adapting the experience of fact checking into Facebook instead of a third party website can help bridge the gap between accountability, curation and community.</li>
	</ul>

</div>


<div class="col col--2-of-3">

<h2>Research</h2>

<p>A quick round of 7 user interviews was completed with people that mainly use social media to consume news. The goal of the interviews was to understand more about people's attitudes towards news they find on social media and how they decide what to trust.</p>
</div>
<div class="col col--2-of-3">

<h4>People interviewed:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Are skeptical of everything they read on Facebook because of the bias they’ve experienced from most sources.
	<li>Value the convenience Facebook offers while browsing a lot of content.</li>
	<li>Trust sources based on their history and previous familiarity with them.</li>
	<li>Use repetition by other sources within the Facebook timeline to assess  the accuracy and legitimacy of an article.</li>
</ul>

</div>

<div class="col col--2-of-3">

<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>What I learned through the interviews helped me revise my hypothesis and formulate a new more granular problem to design for. Instead of people having difficulty finding accurate news I found that:</p>
<q class="big">People find fact-checking news on Facebook time-consuming.</q>

	<h3>Quick Prototyping</h3>
	<p>I took some screenshots of the current mobile Facebook iPhone App and sketched several feature options over the current interface. With these sketches I created a <a href="invis.io/AYCKZQOG3">lo-fi prototype </a> on inVision. I showed it to my classmates and applied their feedback in the next step. Seeing that I had a couple user tasks hinted in the sketches, it was time to put these to the test in a higher fidelity prototype.</p>

	<h2>User Testing</h2>
	<p>When I knew which user tasks I wanted to test, I created a high fidelity Facebook timeline, with dummy text and set up a <a href="https://invis.io/7VCL02LBS">higher fidelity prototype</a> through inVision. Found 4 people to conduct user research with. And tested the following user tasks:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Fact-check an article you want to read.</li>
		<li>Learn more about a publisher you're fact-checking.</li>
		<li>Find related news about an article you don't trust.</li>

	<h2>Insights and Next Steps</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>Create and test updated prototype with real content from Open Sources.</li>
			<li>Design and test ways to intervene on the fb timeline other than icons.</li>
			<li>Decide on the platform for the integrated experience, Chrome Extension or Facebook Native.</li>
			<li>Integrate and test voting system (With Steam Reviews and Tomatometer precedents as inspiration)</li>
			<li>Integrate and test related perspectives (related news) functionality.</li>
			<li>Explore and Test ways to onboard users to the Facebook integrated experience.</li>
